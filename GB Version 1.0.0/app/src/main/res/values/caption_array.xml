        <item>Somewhere between all our laughs, long talks, stupid little fights, and inside jokes, I fell in love.</item>
        <item> When I tell you I love you, I don\'t say it out of habit. I say it to remind you that you\'re the best thing that ever happened to me.</item>
        <item>Thank you, my love, for making me feel like the most beautiful person in the world.</item>
        <item>I had no plans of falling in love with you. But now that I have, I plan to stay in love with you forever.</item>

        <item>I love you more than I can say. You’re my favorite person of all time.</item>
        <item>My love is all yours for the rest of my life, my queen.</item>

        <item>I can never think of anyone else who could love me so deeply!</item>
        <item>Everything feels empty when you are not around, but our love is what keeps me going. Miss you, babe.</item>
        <item>Nothing can explain fully how fortunate I am to have you in my life. Love you sincerely. </item>
        <item>Darling, Thanks for giving so much love. I am so happy to be with you.</item>
        <item>If I ever found a genie in a bottle, I would spend my three wishes wanting you by my side forever.</item>
        <item>You are my greatest possession and I cannot risk losing you for anything. </item>
        <item> It’s been said that you only truly fall in love once, but I don’t believe it. Every time I see you, I fall in love all over again!</item>
        <item>I love you, in ways you\'ve never been loved, for reasons you\'ve never been told, for longer than you think you deserved and with more than you will ever know existed inside me.</item>
        <item>The more and more I spend time with you, the more and more I realize I am doing the one thing I told myself I would never do again... fall in love.</item>

        <item> The pain is not on the day of missing our dear ones. The pain is really when you live without them and with their presence in your mind.</item>
        <item>Nothing hurts more than realizing he meant everything to you and you meant nothing to him.</item>
        <item>Don\'t trust too much. Don\'t hope too much, because that too much can hurt you so much...</item>
        <item>It\'s hard to answer the question \'what\'s wrong\' when nothing\'s right...</item>
        <item>Pain is the only thing that\'s telling me, I\'m still alive.</item>
        <item>My heart stopped beating since you left.</item>
        <item>One day you realized or look back, you\'ll find I\'m still waiting for you where you left me. Missing you...</item>
        <item>My Smile: Doesn\'t always mean, I\'m happy. Sometimes it means, I can manage and sometimes it just means, I\'m tired of crying...</item>
        <item>You play with my mind, my body my soul, my emotions and yet. I still love you. And you left me. Does that mean me that foolish girl on the planet?</item>
        <item>I don\'t think you understand just how much. I love you.</item>
        <item>One day you\'re going to remember me and how much I loved you... then you\'re going to hate yourself for letting me go.</item>
        <item>A relationship is only made for two. But some bitches don\'t know how to count.</item>
        <item>Never be sad for what is over, just be glad that it was once yours.</item>
        <item>The heart is like a mirror. It can\'t reform after once broken. So, don\'t heart anyone is life.</item>
        <item>The greatest challenge in life is discovering who you are. The second greatest is being happy with what you find.</item>
        <item>Every time I look at the keyboard, I see that you and I are always together.</item>
        <item>I am sorry for all the things, that made you sad and ashamed, I am sorry for all the things that didn\'t do. I am sorry for everything wrong. That I have ever done.</item>
        <item>Please come back I\'m alone.</item>
        <item>No matter what I say or do. I\'m still not over you. No matter how hard I try, you still manage to make me cry. No matter what, I\'m still in love and don\'t know why.</item>
        <item>One of the most amazing things in the world is having someone fall in love with you who you thought you never had a chance with.</item>
        <item>You want me to act like we\'ve never kissed, you want to forget; pretend we\'ve never met, and I\'ve tried and I\'ve tried, but I haven\'t yet... You walk by, and I fall to pieces.</item>
        <item>I miss you so much hope you miss me too.</item>
        <item>Without communication there is no relationship without respect, there is no love, without trust, there is no reason to continue.</item>
        <item>No person deserves your tears and who deserves them won\'t make you cry.</item>
        <item>Time goes by a lot slower when you miss the one you love.</item>
        <item>I have seen you at your worst, I think you are the best.</item>
        <item>I\'m slowly giving up.I\'m slowly giving up.</item>
        <item>But when you walked out the door a piece of me died.</item>
        <item>When you sit lonely, then you think about your pastime.</item>
        <item>And tonight, I\'ll fall asleep with you in my heart.</item>
        <item>I would love to tell you how I feel. I\'m just afraid that you don\'t feel the same way.</item>
        <item>It takes a minute to like someone an hour to love some but to forget someone takes a lifetime.</item>
        <item>In the book of life, the answers aren\'t in the back.</item>
        <item>If you see a friend without a smile; give him one of yours.</item>
        <item>Nobody deserves your tears, but whoever deserves them will not make you cry.</item>
        <item>All good things must come to an end, but all bad things can continue forever.</item>
        <item>The walls we build around us to keep sadness out also keeps out the joy.</item>
        <item>It\'s easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will reject you or die.</item>
        <item>Good humour is the health of the soul, sadness its poison.</item>
        <item>Smile, even if it\'s a sad smile because sadder than a sad smile is the sadness of not knowing how to smile.</item>
        <item>Anger, tears, and sadness are only for those who have given up.</item>
        <item>Absolute silence leads to sadness. It is the image of death.</item>
        <item>Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.</item>

        <item>Sorrow is one of the vibrations that prove the fact of living.</item>
        <item>There is no worse sorrow than remembering happiness in the day of sorrow.</item>
        <item>When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.</item>
        <item>Sadness is always the legacy of the past; regrets are pains of the memory.</item>
        <item>We gather strength from sadness and from pain Each time we die we learn to live again.</item>
        <item>Sorrow is like a precious treasure, shown only to friends.</item>
        <item>Tears are words the heart can\'t express.</item>
        <item>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</item>
        <item>Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It\'s the transition that\'s troublesome.</item>
        <item>There is no greater sorrow than to recall in misery the time when we were happy.</item>
        <item>Hating people is like burning down your house to kill a rat.</item>
        <item>As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.</item>
        <item>It is loneliness that makes the loudest noise. This is true of men as of dogs.</item>
        <item>Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.</item>
        <item>I’ll be okay is that what you want to say?</item>
        <item>The World is mad and the people are sad.</item>
        <item>But they all didn’t see the little bit of sadness in me.</item>
        <item>Never put your happiness in someone else’s hands.</item>
        <item>Be careful who you fall in love with, because someone somewhere not approves.</item>
        <item>A feeling of sadness seemingly without a cause.</item>
        <item>I did everything right for someone that does everything wrong.</item>
        <item>Sometimes it takes losing something to realize what you’ve had.</item>
        <item>Yesterday I was sad today I am happy yesterday I had a problem today I still have the same problem.</item>
        <item>My tears are like anchors that sink my heart to the depths of the deepest ocean.</item>
        <item>People walk away easily but they leave their memories with us forever.</item>
        <item>I was born with an enormous need for affection and a terrible need to give it.</item>
        <item>Don’t take me for granted, because unlike the rest. I am not afraid to walk away.</item>
        <item>I hate when I am lying in bed looking out my window for the moon and stars, but I can’t find the Moon.</item>
        <item>We are unhappier to see people ahead of us than happy to see people behind us.</item>
        <item>Dear Hear, please stop getting involved in everything. Your job is to pump blood that\'s it.</item>
        <item>The strongest among us are the ones who smile through the silent pain, cry behind closed doors and fight battles nobody knows about.</item>
        <item>It hurts the most when the person who made you feel so special yesterday makes you feel so unwanted today.</item>
        <item>Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the people who are right beside you.</item>
        <item>People cry, not because they\'re weak. It\'s because they\'ve been strong for too long.</item>
        <item>You made me feel like you really liked me and then you just left like nothing even mattered.</item>
        <item>Sometimes when I say: I\'m okay. I want someone to look me in the eyes, hug me tight, and say: I know you\'re not.</item>
        <item>When I see you smile and know that it is not for me, that is when I will miss you the most.</item>
        <item>I want to write \'I miss you\' on a rock and throw it at your face, so you know how much it hurts to miss you.</item>
        <item>I\'m not afraid to fall in love. I\'m afraid to fall for the wrong person again. Sometimes life doesn\'t want to give you something you want, not because you don\'t deserve it, but because you deserve more.</item>
        <item>During the day I keep myself busy and sometimes time passes. But at night, I really miss you.</item>
        <item>The same person who said the sweetest things to me also said some of the meanest things I\'ve ever heard.</item>
        <item>The worst kind of pain is when you\'re smiling to stop the tears from falling.</item>
        <item>Loves when you listen to a song and it relates 100% sure to how you feel.</item>
